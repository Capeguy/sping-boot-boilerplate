# 🚀 Coding Challenge - Java Spring Boot API Development

## 📝 Introduction

Welcome to the Java Spring Boot API Development challenge! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a set of REST APIs for managing users using the given Java Spring Boot boilerplate project.

Your task is to create, list, get, update, and delete users using the following APIs:

1. 🙋 Create User API: Implement a POST API to create a user.
2. 📋 List Users API: Implement a GET API to list all users.
3. 🔍 Get User API: Implement a GET API to get a single user.
4. 📝 Update User API: Implement a PUT API to update a user.
5. 🗑️ Delete User API: Implement a DELETE API to delete a user.

> You can refer to https://reqres.in/ for the request payload and response.

## 📋 Requirements:

* You should use Java Spring Boot to implement the APIs.
* You should implement proper error handling and return appropriate error responses in case of invalid requests or errors.
* You should write unit tests to test your API endpoints.

## 🎁 Bonus:

1. Implement pagination for the List Users API.
2. Implement validation for the Create and Update User APIs to ensure that the name and job fields are not empty and have a maximum length of 50 characters.
## 📤 Submission:

* Use this Gitpod to do your development. 
* You are allowed to use Google and Stack Overflow. However, you will be quizzed on how your code works. 
* Implement the above APIs. 
* Write unit tests to test your API endpoints. 
* When you are done, please run the test command and show the output of the test execution. 
Once the test execution has completed successfully, inform your interviewer.
